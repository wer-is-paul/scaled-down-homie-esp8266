# Scaled Down Homie for ESP8266 / ESP32

![homie-esp8266 banner](banner.png)

An Arduino for ESP8266 implementation of [Homie](https://github.com/homieiot/convention), an MQTT convention for the IoT. It implements [Homie 3.0.1](https://github.com/homieiot/convention/releases/tag/v3.0.1).

[![works with MQTT Homie](https://homieiot.github.io/img/works-with-homie.svg "works with MQTT Homie")](https://homieiot.github.io/)

The idea of this Repo is to remove the overhead (config page, included mqtt client etc.) to use the homie conventions for tinker projects.
